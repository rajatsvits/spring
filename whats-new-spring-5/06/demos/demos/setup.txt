The samples from this module can just be imported into your IDE and ran. Since this is a What's New course, it isn't how to build everything from scratch. These projects run as Java projects and just need to be imported from a workspace directory.

The Kotlin project will need to be ran as in the course. First run the command grade wrapper and then ./gradlew bootRun
